Subject: [PATCH v2] Add en_ID locale for Indonesian English

Hello,

This is an updated submission of the en_ID locale, originally proposed in 2015
(Bug #19010). The locale has been updated to current glibc standards and has
been tested extensively.

Changes since v1 (2015):
- Updated to current glibc locale format standards
- Improved LC_MESSAGES by inheriting from en_SG
- Added comprehensive test suite
- Field tested by users over several years

Justification:
Indonesia's English-speaking population has grown significantly:
- Population now 280+ million (was 250M in 2015)  
- Tech sector growth (unicorns: Gojek, Tokopedia, Traveloka, etc.)
- ASEAN economic integration increasing English usage
- Remote work trends post-COVID driving English proficiency
- Estimated 10-15 million daily English users

The locale combines:
- British English spelling (standard in Indonesian education)
- Indonesian regional settings (IDR currency, date formats)
- Business-appropriate defaults (24-hour time, ISO dates)

The locale definition and test suite are available at:

I'm happy to make any adjustments needed for inclusion.

Best regards,
