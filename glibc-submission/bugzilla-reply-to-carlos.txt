Subject: Re: Update on en_ID locale submission

Hi Carlos,

Thank you for the detailed feedback. I've addressed all the points you raised:

1. Added the required copyright disclaimer to the locale file:
   % This file is part of the GNU C Library and contains locale data.
   % The Free Software Foundation does not claim any copyright interest
   % in the locale data contained in this file...

2. Converted all Unicode code points to their associated characters throughout the file:
   - int_curr_symbol "IDR "
   - currency_symbol "Rp"
   - abday "Sun";"Mon";"Tue";"Wed";"Thu";"Fri";"Sat"
   etc.

3. Updated the locale to current standards with revision "2.0" and date "2024-06-27"

I've reviewed the contribution checklist and prepared the submission following those guidelines. The updated locale file is ready at:
https://github.com/Open-Technology-Foundation/en_ID/tree/main/glibc-submission

I will now proceed to submit the patch to libc-alpha@sourceware.org as requested, referencing this bug #19010.

Thank you for your guidance on the submission process.

Best regards,
