Subject: Update on en_ID locale submission

Hello,

I'm following up on this locale submission from 2015. I would like to resubmit the en_ID locale with significant updates and stronger justification.

Since the original submission:

1. The locale has been actively maintained and tested by users
2. Indonesia's English-speaking population has grown significantly
3. The locale has been updated to current glibc standards

Key updates:
- Now inherits LC_MESSAGES from en_SG (instead of en_GB) for regional consistency
- Comprehensive test suite added
- All locale categories verified against current glibc requirements
- Successfully tested on Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, and 24.04

Current justification:
- Indonesia's population: 280+ million (up from 250M in 2015)
- Major tech sector growth with multiple unicorns (Gojek, Tokopedia, etc.)
- Increased English usage in business and remote work post-COVID
- ASEAN economic integration driving English adoption
- Estimated 10-15 million daily English users (5%+ of population)

The updated locale is maintained at:
https://github.com/Open-Technology-Foundation/en_ID

I will be submitting an updated patch to the libc-alpha@sourceware.org mailing list shortly. The locale has been field-tested and is ready for inclusion in glibc.

Would it be appropriate to reuse this bug for the v2 submission, or should I open a new bug?

Thank you for your consideration.
